## Overview
This is an example repo that was used for the April 8, 2016 TDD workshop.

## Tutorial

### User Story
As a user I want to see a list of articles displayed on the page. (WUIW-001)

**Potential Sub-Tasks**

1. Create a service to retrieve a list of articles from a data source. (WUIW-002)
1. Create a controller to store the articles. (WUIW-003)
1. Create an HTML template to display the list of articles. (WUIW-004)
1. Create a view/directive to output the template. (WUIW-005)

### Step 1: Create a service (WUIW-002)
The service should retrieve a list of articles from an external data source, providing a JSON object response.

### Step 2: Create a controller (WUIW-003)
The controller should store the list of articles as an array, to be iterated over when displayed to the user.

### Step 3: Create a HTML template (WUIW-004)
The HTML template should a simple ,potentially stylized, list of article details.  

### Step 4: Create a view/directive to output the template (WUIW-005)
Depending on time allotted, we will attempt to create a directive that can be used to output the articles list.

### Getting Started
Now that we have our clearly defined tasks, we start to setup our files.

- Branch off to a feature branch
- Create service branch
